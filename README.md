# Working with the for Loop

This program has the user input a number n and then finds the mean of the first n positive integers.

Examine and run the code to see how it functions.

Modify the code so that it computes the mean of the consecutive positive integers  _n, n+1, n+2, . . . , m,_ where the user chooses _n_ and _m._ 

For example, if the user picks 3 and 9, then the program should find the mean of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, which is 6.
